# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description

I was tasked with developing the JS for a web app that tracks employee salaries. This app can now create a spreadsheet for first and last names, as well as their respective salaries. When opening the console you can see the average salary and the random employee assigned to the night shift.

## Usage

To add a new employee, simply click the "Add Employees" button. You will be prompted to add a first name, last name and salary. After you may choose to add another employee or quit. The information will be updated onto a spreadsheet. Open the console to find the average salary and random employee assigned to the night shift.
